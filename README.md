This steps will guide you to install the latex snippets for vscode.

### Prerequisites

For use this tool you need to have installed:
- Vscode extension [HyperSnips](https://github.com/draivin/hsnips), you can install it from the [vscode extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=draivin.hsnips)

- To use the calculations function you need to have installed [math-expressions](https://github.com/Doenet/math-expressions)
  - You can install it running the command
    ```
    # npm i math-expressions -g
    ```

### Installing

The first step is install and enable HyperSnips in your vscode.

Then, depending on the platform you are using, you have to go the configuration folder of the Hypersnips extension:
- Windows: ```%APPDATA%\Code\User\hsnips```
- Mac: ```$HOME/Library/Application Support/Code/User/hsnips```
- Linux: ```$HOME/.config/Code/User/hsnips```

For the next step, you need the configuration file for the extension. For this clone the repository and copy the file ```all.hsnips``` to the configuration folder.

Last step is reload the extension. You can do it by pressing ```ctrl + alt + p``` and write ``` HyperSnips: Reload Snippets``` on the pop-up window.

You can now start writing your latex files. Open a new file and write ```template``` and press ```tab``` to generate a latex template. Enjoy
